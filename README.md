# Walmart Sales Prediction
This project is a part of the Post Graduate Program Certification Course in Data Science Engineering at [GreatLearning Institute](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Introduction/Objective:
Conventional retail stores still play a prominent role in a world dominated by Ecommerce. As time has passed, retailers have had to evolve in order to keep up with changes in demands and the ever-changing mindset of customers. One such retail industry juggernaut that has kept up with the demands of customers as well changed the face of the retail industry for the better is Walmart Inc. We are trying to build a model to improve the sales of the organization as well as better service for the customers.

## Getting Started

### Dataset and Domain 
This dataset was downloaded from the Kaggle platform which has three years weekly sales data and under the domain of Marketing Analysis.

### Data Dictionary and Variable Categorization 
The data sources for the project have been downloaded from Kaggle and was used in Competitions hosted on Kaggle.

The datasets consist of historic data of weekly sales for different stores of Walmart. There are 400000+ records classified into different stores, departments, size and has markdowns (promotions).
Below table lists the number of features that is available for this dataset. We can classify the features based on the datatype or their behaviour. We can broadly classify the features as either numeric or categorical. 
**Quantitative variables** are any variables where the data represent amounts (e.g., weekly sales, weight, or age). These are broadly called as numerical variables or features. 
Categorical variables are any variables where the data represent groups. This includes rankings (e.g., finishing places in a race), classifications (e.g., brands of cereal), and binary outcomes (e.g., coin flips).
